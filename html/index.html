            <h1>Apparition of a Butterfly</h1>

            <p>Upon a fuzzy vista – vision blurred –</br>
            I tried to focus; nothing ever solid</br>
            Came to view, but undeterred, I blinked</br>
            An eye to try again. Through the mist</br>
            A coloured hue; polychromatic flames</br>
            Had flickered at a whim; a rhythm bore</br>
            A thrumming too: a naturalistic hymn.</br>
            Behold! Were I to find a synonym to</br>
            Reproduce or recreate</br>
            The apparition of a butterfly,</br>
            Evolving through the waning vapour,</br>
            Drawing on a sigh from this romantic.</br>
            Glory be! The raging sun above</br>
            Had fired his furnace, flaming off</br>
            The hangers on. Now I saw the flare: </br>
            His time has come. He spread a tortoiseshell –</br>
            A scene of Mother Nature at her best.</br>
            I lay in peace in knowing I was blessed.</p>

            <h1>Ode to Joy</h1>

            <p>
              Wild and fearful in his cavern</br>
              Hid the naked troglodyte,</br>
              And the homeless nomad wandered</br>
              Laying waste the fertile plain.</br>
              Menacing with spear and arrow</br>
              In the woods the hunter strayed ...</br>
              Woe to all poor wreteches stranded </br>
              On those cruel and hostile shores!</br>
            </br>
              From the peak of high Olympus</br>
              Came the mother Ceres down,</br>
              Seeeking in those savage regions</br>
              Her lost daughter Prosperine.</br>
              But the Goddess found no refuge,</br>
              Found no kindly welcome there,</br>
              And no temple bearing witness</br>
              To the worship of the gods.</p>

          <h1>Dover Beach</h1>
          <p>
            The sea is calm to-night.</br>
            The tide is full, the moon lies fair</br>
            Upon the straits;--on the French coast the light</br>
            Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,</br>
            Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.</br>
            Come to the window, sweet is the night air!</br>
            Only, from the long line of spray</br>
            Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,</br>
            Listen! you hear the grating roar</br>
            Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,</br>
            At their return, up the high strand,</br>
            Begin, and cease, and then again begin,</br>
            With tremulous cadence slow, and bring</br>
            The eternal note of sadness in.</p>

          <h1>Get Drunk</h1>
          <p>Always be drunk.</br>
            That's it!</br>
            The great imperative!</br>
            In order not to feel</br>
            Time's horrid fardel</br>
            bruise your shoulders,</br>
            grinding you into the earth,</br>
            get drunk and stay that way.</br>
            On what?</br>
            On wine, poetry, virtue, whatever.</br>
            But get drunk.</br>
            And if you sometimes happen to wake up</br>
            on the porches of a palace,</br>
            in the green grass of a ditch,</br>
            in the dismal loneliness</br>
            of your own room,</br>
            your drunkenness gone or disappearing,</br>
            ask the wind,</br>
            the wave,</br>
            the star,</br>
            the bird,</br>
            the clock,</br>
            ask everything that flees,</br>
            everything that groans</br>
            or rolls</br>
            or sings,</br>
            everything that speaks,</br>
            ask what time it is;</br>
            and the wind, </br>
            the wave, </br>
            the star,</br>
            the bird, </br>
            the clock</br>
            will answer you:</br>
            "Time to get drunk!</br>
            Don't be martyred slaves of Time,</br>
            Get drunk!</br>
            Stay drunk!</br>
            On wine, virtue, poetry, whatever!"</br>

             Your doleful dreriment:</br>
            Now lay those sorrowfull complaints aside,</br>
            And having all your heads with girland crownd,</br>
            Helpe me mine owne loves prayses to resound;</br>
